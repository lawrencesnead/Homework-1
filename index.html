                <p>My name name is Lawrence Snead, and I am 29 years old. I was born in Richmond, VA. I have lived in the Richmond area most of my life, moving around near by. I now live with my cat, Jasmine, in Ashland on the family farm. </p>

                <p>I am currently employed as a loan processor at Presidential Bank Mortgage. They are a great company to work for, but I grow tired of the repetitive tasks everyday. I have always enjoyed programming, and its frustrating it took me this long to realize I needed to make a career out of it. When I was in 8th grade, I taught myself HTML with Microsoft Front Page and a book. I have also taken a few programming classes throughout my life, and I have a basic understanding of Python and Java. I am seeking a career change and have enrolled in a web development bootcamp to hone my skills like a fine blade.</p>
